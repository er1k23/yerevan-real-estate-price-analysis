Real Estate Market Data Analysis
Goal

Collect, clean, and analyze real estate listing data to explore property price patterns and key housing characteristics.

The project focuses on building a complete data pipeline — from web scraping raw listings to preparing a structured dataset for analysis.

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of scraped real estate listings containing:

Property price

Area (m²)

Location / Address

Additional listing attributes

Raw data was collected using web scraping techniques and processed to handle missing values, standardize formats, and remove unrealistic outliers.

The final cleaned dataset is exported in CSV format for further analysis.
